## Procedures
- Start: How to begin the game?
- Progression: how to continue
- Special: conditional to other elements in the game
- Resolving: bringing game to an end
- **Rules**:
    - The Authority of the game world, applies in the game world, and they form the exact objects and concepts of the game
    - Rule set specifics everything a player can and cannot do
    - If players don't follow the rules, they're leaving the game
    - **Defining:** objects and conditions: cost of items, ingredients...
    - **Restricting** Player actions, eg chess pawns cannot move backwards
    - **Determining effects** on players (casting skill costs eg 50 mana)
- Rules can be:
    - *inspired* by real life: (gravity)
    - *defy* real rules: (fantasy)
    - *unique* to the game world (eat mushroom ++power in mario)
- Resources:
    - Something of value in the game
    - Main Design
        - Player to *manage* their resources
        - Plater to *obtain* new resources
    - Game should guide players on how to discover, obtain, and use resources appropriately
- Conflict
    - Types of conflict:
        - Obstacles: physical form or mental form
        - Opponents
        - Dilemmas
- Boundaries
    - Separate the game from everything that is not the game
    - Can be physical or conceptual (agreement to play)
    - Most games are closed systems
- Outcome
    - Clear, measurable quantities at the end of the game to offer cathasis (satisfaction)
    - Typically uneven (in PvP only winning side, co-op, defeat boss)
    - Outcome of the game has to be **uncertain and unpredictable** to foster player interest
    - Not all games have simple/measurable outcomes and winners


## Core Mechanics
- Introduction: **action of play (procedure)**
- after mechanics, choose:
    1. Technology
    2. Add aesthetics
    3. Create story
- Core mechanics (8 main)
    1. Reflex
        - How fast you react: timing and unpredictable cues
        - eg street fighter
    2. timing
        - Rythmn game
        - Timing of the cues are predictable
    3. Precision and accuracy
        - Has to be exact and well-aimed
        - FPS games
    4. Measurement
        - Mental calculations about basic kinematics, such as predict jump distance, swing distance, rotational force, and inertia
        - eg Assassins' creed
    5. Tactical choice
        - deciding actions that need to be immediately taken during dilemmatic or difficult situations
        - stealth games, Metal Gear
        - short term benefits
    6. Strategy
        - Planning a few steps ahead to maximise future benefits
        - weights long term benefits
        - Tower defense, minecraft
    7. Management
        - Controlling resources or people
        - Games with management mechanics
    8. Puzzles
        - pure thinking game
        - games that can be resolved mentally
        - eg. portal, cut the rope
- Usually only 1 dominant mechanic

## Video Game Genre
- Combination of mechanics make up a genre

1. Adventure Games
    - Story-based games, rely on puzzle solving to advance the game
    - Not in real-time
    - Easy Navigation: point and click
    - Expected to have a large, complex world to explore, interesting characters and good story
2. Action Games
    - Real time games
    - Ideal for those looking to go for a past-paced action
    - Snap judgments and quick reflexes
3. Role-Playing games
    - Directs a group of heroes on a series of quests
    - Skills evolve and gain over time  **(main differentiating factor from adventure quests)**
    - Huge world with gradually unfolding story
    - micro-manage characters
4. Strategy:
    - Real time strategy: sets AI against players
    - manage limited set of resources
    - involves deciding which kinds of units to create and where to put
5. Simulation:
    - emulate real world operating conditions
    - Accuracy is crucial
    - Involves learning
6. Fighting Games
    - 2 player games
    - Each player controls one character
    - Generally viewed from a side perspective
    - Basic set of attacks and counters
7. Casual Games
    - Drop in and out quickly
    - Already familiar
    - simple user interface, with little to no learning curve
8. God Games
    - no real goal, no winning conditions
    - encourage player to fool around with the game and see what happens
    - Designers try to create games in which the player can do no wrong
9. Educational Games
    - Games that teach while they entertain
    - age appropriate, for much younger audience
10. Puzzle Games
    - Purely for intellectual challenge of problem solving
    - Puzzles are an end in themselves, not integrated into story (this is for adventure games)
11. Online Games
    - May include any of the preceding genres, but played over the internet
    - Entire communities grow around the most successful of these games
