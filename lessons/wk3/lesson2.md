# Rules
- Limit action
- Explicit and unambiguous
- Shared
- fixed
- binding
- repeatable


## Kinds of rules
1. Operational
2. Constituitive: 
3. Implicit: unwritten


## Game identity
- *Interaction* between operational and constituative rules makes it unique


## Principles
- Balance
    - Game balance should be preserved
    - fair
    - effort -> payoff, linearly related
    - Balanced if there is no optimal solution for the game
- Asymmetry
    - Asymmetric ability
    - Asymmetric goals
    - Asymmetric information and resources distribution
