1. [Important Rules](#rules)

## Rules
- **OVERALL**
    - Basic & meta: must-have rules (must work properly, etc)
    - Feedback: clear hints and indications
    - Psychological: keep things interesting
    - Extra: add subgames

- First Rule: #47 - Gameplay comes first
    - Has to be <span style="color:orange">**playable**</span>
    - Emphasize gameplay more than other elements (eg story, special effects, fidelity)
    - Game has to work properly (no bugs)
- #31 - Common sense when applying rules
    - Any rule, carried to the extremes, can become <span style="color:orange">**non-functional**</span>
    - Don't follow any rule blindly
    - Don't make games where things are impossible to do
- #1 - Fight Player Fatigue
    - Very important
    - Games are a challenge, and playing takes effort - actively work to keep player involved
    - <span style="color:orange">**Ensure appeal of game always exceeds its difficulty**
    - Nobody wants to play a game that's too hard or too easy (for the age group)
- #50 & #51 - As simple as possible
    - Everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler
    - <span style="color:orange">**Simple gameplay, simple interface, intuitive**</span>
    - When trying to reach a wider audience, the simpler the interface, the better
- #6 - Provide clear short term goals
    - Always make it clear to the player what their <span style="color:orange">**short term objectives are.**</span> This can be done explicitly by telling them directly, or by implicitly by leadiwng them towards those goals through environmental cues. This avoids the frustration of uncertainty and gives players confidence that they are making forward progress.
    - Example: *Quests board and maps*
- #61 - Players should be able to see their goal
- #59 - Make the players feel smart
    - Provide avenues for the player to feel clever
- #69 - previde a reaction to every player action
    - Ideally, *every action* a player can take should have some sort of **feedback**, visual, audible, or both.
- #46 - Raise the emotional stakes to maximise player involvement
    - A meta-rule with many more specific examples, this should be the underlying rule behind many design decisions about story, characters, and theme, as well as choices of gameplay
    - Make players have a *particular emotional interest* in the outcome
- #62 - Make Challenges require skill
    - A game should be difficult enough to **avoid player fatigue**
- #55 - Make the game appear fair to the player
    - Computer-controlled opponents **should not appear to be taking advantage of information that would not be available to a human in the same position**
    - Indicate monster level difficulty
- #16 - Distribute game assets asymmetrically
- #5 - Make subgames
    - Players can get bored, want to take a break
- #52 - Make game familiar, yet different
    - Another "Make it fun" specific rule. All successful games have a **mix of familiar elements and some fresh or unique variations.** 


## What is a game?
- Successful game design?
    - successful when there is *meaningful play*
        - The process by which a player takes action within the designed system of a game and the system responds to the action
            - Any action produces outcome
        - **Descriptive**
        - **Evaluative**: relationships between actions and outcomes in a game are both discernable (immediate perceivable) and integrated (affects the game in the later point) into the larger context of the game.
